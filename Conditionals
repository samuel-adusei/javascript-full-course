Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.

You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed



var samuel = 170;
var daniel = 150;
var sage = 22;
var dage = 20;

var scoresamuel = samuel + 5 * sage;
var scoredaniel = daniel + 5 * dage;

if(samuel > daniel) {
	console.log( "Samuel wins with" scoresamuel " points");
	else if(samuel === daniel) {
		console.log("This is a draw");
	} else if(samuel > daniel){
		console.log("Daniel wins with" scoredaniel  "points");
	}

}
